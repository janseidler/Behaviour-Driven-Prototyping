The problem or needs field is where the co-creator sets out to define their problem in order to create the right thing.

### "Das nervt mich..."

## Solution Field

Co-Create the thing right. Once the problem has been defined, it is time to go about finding the right solution by prototyping different possible solutions with a simple causality chain "When something happens, then something else happens." (cause and effect)

### WENN

The first part of the causality chain: "When something happens..." (the cause)
