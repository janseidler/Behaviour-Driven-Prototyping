A new methodology for rapid, playful, co-creative, behaviour-driven prototyping. 

This repository contains all artefacts created for the co-creative prototyping method Behaviour-Driven Prototyping (BDP).

More information about can be found from the following sources:

* [Behaviour-Driven Prototyping 1.0.0.](https://portal.intia.de/methods/bdp) - Step-by-step guide for using this method
* Story: Partizipative Prototypisierung von Technischen LÃ¶sungsideen mittels Behaviour-Driven Prototyping

# Getting Started
For a quick getting started it is important to print the materials and read the How-to-Play instructions.

## Print and Cut the Materials

* Print the [prototyping cards](https://github.com/th-koeln-intia/behaviour-driven-prototyping/tree/main/prototyping-cards)
* Cut the [prototyping fields](https://github.com/th-koeln-intia/behaviour-driven-prototyping/tree/main/prototyping-fields) into their respective shapes
* Print the How-to-Play instructions

## How to Play Instructions
